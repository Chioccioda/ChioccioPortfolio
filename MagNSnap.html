Fully functional motorbike accessory made in several copies. The product went through a long and extensive study and prototyping phase to understand the performance achieved in terms of vibration damping and the needs of users. Compared to the competitors, it boasts all the premium features in one compact body without requiring the user to fit a proprietary cover on his phone. Operation requires only one hand: simply pull one of the two clamps outwards (they will automatically lock in the open position), align the mobile phone thanks to the MagSafe magnets, and then snap the clamps into the closed position with a slight inward pressure: the mobile phone is thus secured, aligned for wireless charging, and protected from damaging motor vibrations thanks to the integrated vibration damper.</p>

							</p>The prototypes were built in modules in such a way that it is easy to remove, modify or compare the damper, and this also ensures that the position of the mobile phone in relation to the bike always varies the least (i.e. only by the thickness of the damper itself) and that it is always held in place in the same way. The device used for data collection is an iPhone 13 with the “Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite” app (by Chrystian Vieyra) in linear acceleration mode, which, in fact, measures the variation in acceleration over time (in m/s²) on the three axes of the sensor and also sums the modules of the three values; the sensor and the app allow a reading update rate of 100 Hz, sufficient for an accurate graph. <br />
							It was decided to individually study specific engine rotation speeds in order to simplify and have a clean reading, unaffected by any resonances given by the increase or decrease in revolutions. These RPMs are dictated by Apple's guidance (and common sense) that damage occurs especially with prolonged exposure to certain vibrations.  It was decided to examine 
							engine rmps that are often kept fixed, or almost fixed, while driving, such as:<br />
							<ul>
								<li>Idle speed, often maintained in city driving at traffic lights or in traffic and in any case easy to record as a base speed</li>
								<li>Quiet' driving speed, often maintained in urban contexts and secondary roads</li>
								</li>Motorway regime, maintained during long transfers for several hours in sixth gear</li>
								</li>Enthusiastic driving speed, higher than motorway speed, when fully utilising the gears between corners to maintain high torque from the engine.</li>
							</ul>
							
							Obviously, the specific value of these revs and their 
							“distancing” is characteristic and function of many variables, primarily those of: displacement, engine geometry, 
							primary and final drive.
							The vehicles examined have these variables in their 
							“standard configuration”. as produced by the parent company 
							, and therefore representative of most 
							similar vehicles in circulation. The bikes examined (and available at 
							) are:
							Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX: 4-cylinder in-line 
							front-end
							Triumph Bonneville T100: 2-cylinder in-line 
							front-end
							both considered to be of high displacement and power 
							(as specified by Apple), of a very different nature between 
							them, are good examples to analyse.
							In both cases, data collection was carried out 
							by keeping the engine rpm fixed at a certain value 
							for 5 seconds or so so in order to eliminate 
							any peaks due to reaching the desired 
							number of revs or releasing the throttle. In between 
							the name of the file corresponding to the speed 
							just tested and its configuration was jotted down and then processed 
							in the correct order</p>
